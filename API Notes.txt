Regional patterns of anthropogenic influences on streams and rivers in the conterminous United States, from the early 1970s to 2012
-- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/1747423X.2019.1590473
-- Underlying data at https://doi.org/10.5066/F7XW4J1J
-- Land Use (data set 8) shows both NLCDs (National Land Cover Database) and NWALTS (NAWQA Wall-to-Wall Anthropogenic Land Use Trends). The NLCD data goes back to 2001. The NWALT data goes back to 1974.
-- Both the NWALT and NLCD data sets are geographically broken down by 
	• county (3,109 in the US),
	• ECO4 (967 in the US), and
	• HUC10 (Hydrologic Unit Code 10s), of which there are 15,458 in the US.
-- Key results presented here include: 
	• increases in urbanization and ‘exurbanization’ across every time period, particularly in the South, Southwest, and Mid-Atlantic, but higher density urbanization occurring in portions of the West and particularly California; 
	• increases in crop production and nutrients in much of the Midwest; 
	• increases in livestock concentration, particularly of hogs and pigs; 
	• increases in irrigation, dams, and reservoirs in the Lower Mississippi and Lower Missouri watersheds, but a decrease broadly in the pace of new dam construction; 
	• increases in CRP land in several regions between 1992 and 2012, notably the Lower Mississippi, but decreases in other areas, such as the Upper Missouri; 
	• a widespread increase in the pesticide glyphosate, with a 40-fold increase in some regions between 1992 and 2012, but generally broadly occurring decreases of alachlor, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion use in this same period.; 
	• and a widespread decrease in atmospheric deposition of sulfate.
