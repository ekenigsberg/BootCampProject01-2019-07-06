The focus of the data is on anthropogenic changes over time.</purpose><supplinf>One comma-separated text file is given here. The file contains a "uniqid" field, which is the link to the data in all other datasets in this product. Each file has 15,458 rows.
Data are most appropriate for broad-scale applications and calculations; original source data are from county-level values.  Users should be cognizant of some potential issues in comparing water use over time: water use values may change for various reasons: counties may begin importing or exporting water, industries may open or close between years, or jurisdictional/political changes may occur.  For example, a change may occur in how two adjacent counties are permitted to withdraw from a common river, potentially changing the numbers for each of them quite a bit in a time series.  Some states may have changed the method by which they estimated water use for some uses over time, for example thermoelectric power. Users should be conservative in drawing conclusions about water use trends at fine spatial scales.
HUC-10 boundaries were obtained on January 9, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/huc/folder/39640323180 (National Resources Conservation Service, 2017).
