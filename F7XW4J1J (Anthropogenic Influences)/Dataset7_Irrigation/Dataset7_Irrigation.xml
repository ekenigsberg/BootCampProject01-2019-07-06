One table is for five year periods from 1969-2012 derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Census of Agriculture data, and one table is for five year periods from 2002-2012 derived from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data.  Both tables are for Hydrologic Unit Code 10 (HUC-10) areas.</abstract><purpose>These data are intended to provide a framework in which watershed-specific studies of water quality in streams and rivers may be analyzed. The focus of the data is on anthropogenic changes over time.</purpose><supplinf>Two comma-separated text files are given here. Each file contains a "uniqid" field, which is the link to the data in all other datasets in this product. Each file has 15,458 rows.
Two time series are given here: both represent the same metric, the proportion of the HUC-10 area in irrigation, however they are derived from different data sources.  One table is based on 1969-2012 USDA Census of Agriculture county-level irrigation statistics allocated to agricultural land use pixels (Falcone and LaMotte, 2016). The other table is for three time periods from 2002-2012 USGS data, which were 250-meter (m) irrigation presence/absence based on satellite imagery, land use, and Census of Agriculture statistics (Brown and Pervez, 2014).  The USGS Brown and Pervez data have higher spatial resolution and are likely to be more accurate, however both show similar mappings.  For example, the correlation coefficient (r) between the data for the year 2012 from each source for the HUC-10s given here is 0.98.  However, if the user's time period of analysis only goes back to 2002, it is recommended to use the USGS data.
HUC-10 boundaries were obtained on January 9, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/huc/folder/39640323180 (National Resources Conservation Service, 2017).
