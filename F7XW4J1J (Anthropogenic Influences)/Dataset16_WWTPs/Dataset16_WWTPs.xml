The data from the USEPA Clean Water Needs Survey (Ivahnenko, 2017; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2017), represent the best-available time-series data (1978-2012) for waste water treatment plants. The CWNS data represent 12,688 sites with data for 2012, of which 3,912 are "Major" dischargers (more than 1 million gallons per day).  Because the CWNS program has collected data in a different manner than permitted current sites available from the USEPA (available from https://www3.epa.gov/enviro/facts/multisystem.html), there may be differences between this dataset and what might result from a retrieval of current sites.  Efforts were made in this data compilation to normalize the years in the CWNS dataset to ensure as much comparability over time as possible, as described in the Process Steps.  The number of overall sites with data for each year of the CWNS data assembled here, after normalization, are as follows: 1978: 9,051, 1980: 9,653, 1982: 9,906, 1984: 10,120, 1986: 10,254, 1988: 10,439, 1990: 10,450, 1992: 10,716, 1996: 11,162, 2000: 12,249, 2004: 12,740, 2008: 12,658,  2012: 12,688.
CAUTION: Users should be aware that some gaps and inconsistencies existed in the original CWNS data (see Process Steps below). Efforts were made to normalize the data and make them as comparable as possible over time, however some inconsistencies may still exist, and if so, most likely for the two latest years (2008 and 2012).

These were point locations by year of waste water treatment plants from the USEPA Clean Water Needs Survey (CWNS), which had 13 collection years: every two years from 1978 through 1992, then every four years from 1992 through 2012.  Data provided by Ivahnenko consisted of estimated loads for nitrogen and phosphorus for each site by year, as well as site location. Supplemental data were obtained from the USEPA Permit Compliance System and Integrated Compliance Information System (PCS-ICIS) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016) from Ken Skinner of the U.S. Geological Survey in September, 2017 (written commun., K. Skinner).  These data were subset to only those sites with a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code of 4952 ("Sewerage Systems").  This resulted in a shapefile of 19,756 point locations of currently-permitted WWTPs, representing both "Major" and "Minor" sites, as designated by the USEPA. The latitudes and longitudes of the CWNS sites had been updated from the September 2017 data from Skinner, above, which had been manually verified or adjusted.</procdesc><procdate>20161215</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(2) It was observed that some apparent data gaps existed, and particularly for the year 2008 and 2012 years some states had data inconsistent with previous years.  The USEPA data are collected from state sources. The following checks and modifications were performed on the CWNS data to fill apparent gaps and end-of-record missing data, as described in steps 2a through 2i.  This was done in consultation with Tamara Ivahnenko, the original compiler of the data.
(2a) First, all records which did not have "Outfall to Surface Waters" in the Discharge field (for example, "Deep Well, "Ocean Discharge", and others) were removed.  This eliminated 8% of the overall records.
(2b) Records were organized by site and the time series of estimated nitrogen load (TN) and phosphorus load (TP) were examined.  At this step, 13,226 unique sites existed, of which 3,919 were "Majors".  Of the total number of sites, 54% (7,203) had TN and TP values (values greater than 0) for every year of the 13 years.
(2c) All the sites which had a complete record of TN and TP values for every year since the first non-0 value were flagged as "ok".  That is, all the sites that had data for all 13 years, all the sites with 12 years which started in 1980, all the sites with 11 years which started in 1982, and so on, up to sites with two years of data starting in 2008.  This constituted 10,049 of the 13,226 records (76%) which had no intermediate or end-of-record gaps.
(2d) The number of sites by state with TN and TP data were checked by state, as a time series.  Most states seemed reasonable and typically had a gradual increase in sites with data over time, for example for Missouri: 376 in 1978, 406 in 1980, 412 in 1982,...and so on, up to 649 in 2008 and 667 in 2012. The normal expectation was that the number of WWTPs would generally increase over time. Several states had incongruous drop-offs in the number of sites with data for 2012 and for a few states, both 2008 and 2012: CO, IL, LA, MN, NC, SD, TX, particularly.  For example Texas had 1,011 sites with data for 2008 but only 426 for 2012.  These sites were flagged for "end-of-record filling" (step 2g).
(2e) North Dakota had an extremely unlikely jump in sites for 2012: for every year from 1978 through 2008 there were 41 sites, then in 2012 there were 164.  Since the purpose of the dataset is to be temporally consistent, these 123 "new" sites which incongruously appeared for 2012 were dropped from the dataset.
(2f) At this point the sites that were left (approximately 3,000) had either an intermediate data gap (for example, had data in 1992, nothing in 1996, then data again in 2000), or an end-of record data gap (for example,  had continuous data up to 2008 or 2012, but were missing it for one or both of those years).  The two conditions were distinguished because there is more information about recent status (from Ken Skinner’s list and the EPA PCS-ICIS web site), but little or no information about historical status.
(2g) "End-of-record filling": for sites missing data at the end of the record:  if it was in Skinner’s list (see Process Step 1) or if it was a Major and it had a permit date that was within two years of 2012 on the EPA web site, it was assumed it was active in 2012, and TN and TP were filled with the most previous year’s data.  Most commonly this was to fill 2012, sometimes to fill 2008 and 2012, and in a few cases to fill more years.  For example, if a site was a Major, and had TN and TP data for 2008, but was missing data for 2012, a check was made against the Skinner list and/or the EPA web site.  If it appeared as being "current" in either of those, the TN and TP data for 2012 were filled from 2008.  The result was that 1,925 sites had end-of-record (primarily 2012 only) values for TN and TP filled because the site seemed to be still currently active in 2012.
(2h) "Intermediate-gap filling": If a site had an intermediate gap, (for example, had data in 1992, nothing in 1996, then data again in 2000): after discussing with Tamara Ivahnenko, it was decided that if it was a Minor then the gap could well be legitimate, but if it was a Major, was more likely to be a missing-data issue, in that Majors typically have had continuous operations without breaks.  So for Minors, the intermediate gaps were left as is; for Majors they were filled with the previous year.  125 Majors had data filled in this way.
(2i)  Otherwise data were left as they were in the original Ivahnenko, 2017 dataset, in that there was not clear evidence of a data gap.  The final dataset consisted of 13,103 unique sites.</procdesc><procdate>20161215</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(3) From this shapefile, the density of sites by year and the TN and TP loads per square kilometer of watershed area were calculated, using the ESRI Intersect and Spatial Join tools in ArcToolbox.</procdesc><procdate>20180130</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><eainfo><detailed Name="wwtps-huc10.txt"><enttyp><enttypl>Attribute Table for waste water treatment plant data</enttypl><enttypd>Data consist of a comma-separated text file.
