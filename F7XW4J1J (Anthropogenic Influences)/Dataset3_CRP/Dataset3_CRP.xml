The data represent the proportion of CRP acres to total cropland acres, based on county-level data, for the years 1986-2014.</abstract><purpose>These data are intended to provide a framework in which watershed-specific studies of water quality in streams and rivers may be analyzed. The focus of the data is on anthropogenic changes over time.</purpose><supplinf>One comma-separated text file is given here. The file contains a "uniqid" field, which is the link to the data in all other datasets in this product. Each file has 15,458 rows.
The Conservation Reserve Program is "a land conservation program administered by the Farm Service Agency. In exchange for a yearly rental payment, farmers enrolled in the program agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality". (Farm Service Agency, 2015; https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-program/).
In this dataset, acres of CRP land were divided by total cropland to provide a ratio of CRP usage by county, then intersected with HUC-10 watersheds.  Total cropland is a subset of total farmland. The calculations in this dataset represent watershed averages of county-level data (not allocated to land use pixels), for the HUC-10 watersheds.
The data are identical for 1993 and 1994, as they were the same in the source data downloaded from the CRP website.  It is unknown if this is intentional or not.
HUC-10 boundaries were obtained on January 9, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/huc/folder/39640323180 (National Resources Conservation Service, 2017).
