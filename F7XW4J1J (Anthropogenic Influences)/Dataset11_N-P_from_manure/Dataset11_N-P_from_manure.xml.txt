The values are given as kilograms (kg) per square kilometer (km).</abstract><purpose>These data are intended to provide a framework in which watershed-specific studies of water quality in streams and rivers may be analyzed. The focus of the data is on anthropogenic changes over time.</purpose><supplinf>Two comma-separated text files are given here. The files contain a "uniqid" field, which is the link to the data in other datasets in this product. Each file has 15,458 rows.
HUC-10 boundaries were obtained on January 9, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/huc/folder/39640323180 (National Resources Conservation Service, 2017).

a series of rasters were created which allocated county-level values from the source data to land use pixels of crops and pasture/hay ("agriculture").  This is described in steps 2-4, which follow.</procdesc><procdate>20170211</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(2) County-level tabular source data were taken from Ruddy and others (2006) for 1982-1997, from Mueller and Gronberg (2013) for 2002, and from Gronberg and Arnold (2017) for 2007 and 2012. Adjustments were made to data for Miami-Dade County Florida (FL) and Broomfield County Colorado (CO), to account for boundary/FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) changes since 1985. Dade County (FIPS code 12025) was renamed to Miami-Dade County (FIPS code 12086) in 1997, so for this dataset all years for those counties were assigned the 2000 code of 12086. Broomfield County, Colorado was a new county created in 2001 from parts of four other counties (Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld). In this case, for this dataset, the manure kilogram values for Broomfield for 2007 and 2012 were apportioned back to those four counties according to the proportion of the area that made up Broomfield. Broomfield is thus not mapped as a separate entity in this dataset, but is part of the prior counties.  Broomfield County is a small and primarily urban county, so the adjustments are minor in any case.</procdesc><procdate>20170211</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(3) The tabular data were joined by FIPS code to a 2000-era county boundary polygon shapefile obtained from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS).  Although it is recognized that in addition to Miami-Dade and Broomfield counties, a small number of counties have also had minor boundary changes since 1985, these are primarily urban areas and have minimal effect on this dataset.  The county shapefile was converted to a 1-kilometer (km) raster dataset.</procdesc><procdate>20170211</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(4) The county tabular data were then allocated to pixels classified as Crops and Pasture/Hay (classes 43 and 44, collectively dubbed "Agriculture" here) from the Wall-to-wall Anthropogenic Land-use Trends (NWALT) dataset (Falcone, 2015).  The NWALT is a series of decadal raster datasets from 1974-2012 which map land use at 60-meters for the conterminous U.S. Allocating the county tabular data to only areas where that activity was likely to have occurred improves the spatial mapping of the data.  Specifically, this was done as follows:
(a) Each of the NWALT land use raster datasets was resampled to 1-km, and the percent of each type of land use for each pixel was calculated, resulting in a fraction from 0 to 1. So, for example, a pixel for which 82 percent of the area was calculated as Agricultural use would have a value of 0.82, or 0.82 sq km.
(b) Each pixel’s proportion of the county’s total agricultural use was calculated.  For example, if the county had 100 sq km of agricultural use, the above pixel would represent .0082 of the total county use (0.82 / 100).
(c) The county values in units of kilograms (kg) of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) were then multiplied by that fraction for each pixel.  For example, if the county had 500 kg of N for the year in question, the value assigned to the example pixel would be (500 * 0.0082) = 4.1, that is, 4.1 kg of N from manure estimated for that 1-km pixel.  The NWALT dataset closest in time to the year of the county data was used for each year of the tabular manure data: for 1982 and 1987, the 1982 NWALT was used; for 1992 and 1997, the 1992 NWALT was used; for 2002 and 2007, the 2002 NWALT was used; for 2012, the 2012 NWALT was used.  This had the effect of apportioning the county statistic more accurately, rather than using a single year's land use raster.
(d) A check was performed to ensure that the sum of kg within each county matched the original tabular value, that is, 500 kg in the above example.  Minor differences may exist because of the spatial resolution of the 1-km raster datasets. For these rasters, 99 percent of counties matched the original values to within 5 percent agreement. The raster datasets are stored as floating point ESRI Arc grids. 
This resulted in a series of 1-km raster datasets for which the original county statistics were allocated to feasible areas of the landscape, that is, areas which are reasonably likely to have agricultural. The datasets are designed as a source of information for calculating watershed statistics.</procdesc><procdate>20170211</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(5) HUC-10 watershed mean nitrogen and phosphorus from manure was calculated using the zonalmean() command in ArcGIS Grid.</procdesc><procdate>20180124</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><eainfo><detailed Name="N-P_from_manure_N-huc10.txt, N-P_from_manure_P-huc10.txt"><enttyp><enttypl>Attribute Table for nitrogen and phosphorus from manure data</enttypl><enttypd>Data consist of comma-separated text files.
