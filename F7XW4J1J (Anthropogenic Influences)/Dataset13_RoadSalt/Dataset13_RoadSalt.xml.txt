The focus of the data is on anthropogenic changes over time.</purpose><supplinf>One comma-separated text file is given here. The file contains a "uniqid" field, which is the link to the data in all other datasets in this product. The file has 15,458 rows. 
Data are based on annual 1-kilometer (km) rasters produced by Bock and others (2018). Data are based on state-level rock- and solar-salt used for road application.  These state-level data were then mapped to 1-km pixels according to climate (prevalence of snowfall) and road density. See Bock and others, 2018 for detail.
Users should be cautious with data for a small number of HUCs in northwest Florida, specifically HUCs beginning with HUC id 031401 and 031403.  This is due to all of the allocation of the road salt for the state of Florida being limited to those areas, which are the only areas with a long-term record of recordable snowfall.  Although the road salt usage for the state is typically very low, because what is allocated is mapped in those areas, it may cause anomalously high numbers for a small number of HUCs there.  See Bock and others, 2018 for detail.
HUC-10 boundaries were obtained on January 9, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/huc/folder/39640323180 (National Resources Conservation Service, 2017).
