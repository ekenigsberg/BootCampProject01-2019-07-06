      <abstract>This dataset consists of a table of data regarding the presence of dams and reservoir storage for the period 1972-2013 for Hydrologic Unit Code 10 (HUC-10) areas.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are intended to provide a framework in which watershed-specific studies of water quality in streams and rivers may be analyzed. The focus of the data is on anthropogenic changes over time.</purpose>
      <supplinf>One comma-separated text file is given here. The file contains a "uniqid" field, which is the link to the data in all other datasets in this product. Each file has 15,458 rows.

Data are derived from point locations and associated attributes of dams from the National Inventory of Dams ((NID), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2013). The NID are controlled data not publicly downloadable, but may be requested from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 


HUC-10 boundaries were obtained on January 9, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/huc/folder/39640323180 (National Resources Conservation Service, 2017).

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>(1) The source for dam and reservoir storage data was derived from a modified version of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Inventory of Dams (NID) (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2013). This dataset was created as follows: (a) a 2006-2009 version of the NID used in the GAGES-II dataset (Falcone, 2011) was used as the base.  This dataset had improved locations for approximately 59,000 of 83,000 dams based on USGS verification (Falcone, 2011), and had eliminated several hundred duplicate records of large dams. (b) To this dataset, new records were added from a 2013 version of the NID (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2013).  (c) Approximately 14% of records in this dataset lacked a Year Completed (year the dam was built), some of them large dams. The dams lacking completion dates were also not spread uniformly around the country, but rather were generally concentrated in several geographic areas, so discarding them would lead to very skewed results for those areas. In order to do complete time series work, Year Completion was estimated for these records by creating a 5-kilometer resolution raster "date surface", from an Inversed Distance Weight of the records which did have a Year Completion.  From this surface, an estimate of the completion date was extracted for the records with no date.  This in essence assigns a completion date based on the completion dates of nearby dams. This estimated date was then used for processing for NID records with no dam completion date. The accuracy of the estimated completion date was performed by comparing the estimated completion date against the known completion date for the 86% of records which did have a completion date.  Of these, the median absolute difference between the estimated and known completion date was 4.2 years, and approximately 3/4 of the records had a difference less than 10 years.  Thus the majority of the estimated completion dates are likely to be reasonably close to the actual date for the 14% which were filled. A point shapefile was created from the records.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20160411</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>(2) From this shapefile, variables for number of dams, number of major dams, and storage for each HUC-10 watershed were extracted using the ESRI Intersect and Spatial Join tools in ArcToolbox.  Major dams are defined as being greater than or equal to 50 feet in height or having storage greater than or equal to 5,000 acre feet (National Atlas definition).</procdesc>
