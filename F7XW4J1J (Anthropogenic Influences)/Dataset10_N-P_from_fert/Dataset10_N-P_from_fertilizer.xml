The values are given as kilograms (kg) per square kilometer (km).</abstract><purpose>These data are intended to provide a framework in which watershed-specific studies of water quality in streams and rivers may be analyzed. The focus of the data is on anthropogenic changes over time.</purpose><supplinf>Four comma-separated text files are given here. The files contain a "uniqid" field, which is the link to the data in other datasets in this product. Each file has 15,458 rows.
The data are broken into separate categories of farm and non-farm use. The file N-P_from_fertilizer_farmN0-huc10.txt has nitrogen from farm fertilizer, the file N-P_from_fertilizer_farmP-huc10.txt has phosphorus from farm fertilizer, the file N-P_from_fertilizer_non-farmN-huc10.txt has nitrogen from non-farm fertilizer, and the file N-P_from_fertilizer_non-farmP-huc10.txt has phosphorus from non-farm fertilizer. These data were all derived from county-level data allocated to land use pixels in a consistent way (see Process Description), and the county-level data themselves were all obtained in a similar fashion (Gronberg and Spahr, 2012; Brakebill and Gronberg, 2017).  However, there may still be small differences resulting from data sources when comparing the 1987-2006 data to the 2007-2012 data.  
HUC-10 boundaries were obtained on January 9, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/huc/folder/39640323180 (National Resources Conservation Service, 2017).

(Brakebill and Gronberg (2017) also contain data for 1987-2006, but they are an exact copy of the Gronberg and Spahr (2012) data). The data are broken out as annual estimates of kg of N and P, from both farm and non-Farm fertilizer. Broomfield County, Colorado was a new county created in 2001 from parts of four other counties (Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld). For this dataset, the values for Broomfield for the years from 2002 to 2012 were apportioned back to those four counties according to the proportion of the area from each that made up Broomfield. Broomfield was thus not mapped as a separate entity in this dataset, but is part of the prior counties.  Broomfield is one of the smallest counties in the United States, however (99% of counties are larger), and the effect of this is minor in any case.</procdesc><procdate>20170211</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(2) A series of rasters were created which allocated county-level values from the source data to land use pixels of crops and pasture/hay for Farm fertilizer, and to urban land use pixels for Non-Farm fertilizer.  This was done using the Wall-to-wall Anthropogenic Land-use Trends (NWALT) dataset (Falcone, 2015), and is described in step 4, below.</procdesc><procdate>20170426</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(3) The tabular data were joined by FIPS code to a 2000-era county boundary polygon shapefile obtained from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS, nhgis.org).  Although it is recognized that in addition to Broomfield county, a small number of counties have also had minor boundary changes since 1987, these were believed to have minimal or no effect for the purpose of this dataset. A known FIPS change to Miami-Dade county was already adjusted for in the source data. The county shapefile was converted to a 1-km raster dataset.</procdesc><procdate>20170426</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(4) The county tabular data were then allocated to pixels classified as Crops and Pasture/Hay (classes 43 and 44, collectively dubbed "Agriculture" here) from the NWALT dataset (Falcone, 2015) for farm fertilizer, and to pixels classified as Developed (classes 21-27) for non-farm fertilizer.  The NWALT is a series of decadal raster datasets from 1974-2012 which map land use at 60-meters (m) for the conterminous U.S. Allocating the county tabular data to only areas where that activity was likely to have occurred improves the spatial mapping of the data.  Specifically, this was done as follows:
(a) Each of the NWALT land use raster datasets was resampled to 1-km, and the percent of each type of land use for each pixel was calculated, resulting in a fraction from 0 to 1. So, for example, a pixel for which 82% of the area was calculated as Agricultural use would have a value of 0.82, or 0.82 sq km.
(b) Each pixel’s proportion of the county’s total agricultural use was calculated.  For example, if the county had 100 sq km of agricultural use, the above pixel would represent .0082 of the total county use (0.82 / 100).
(c) The county values in units of kilograms (kg) of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) were then multiplied by that fraction for each pixel.  For example, if the county had 500 kg of N for the year in question, the value assigned to the example pixel would be (500 * 0.0082) = 4.1, that is, 4.1 kg of N from farm fertilizer estimated for that 1-km pixel.  The NWALT dataset closest in time to the year of the county data was used for each year of the tabular fertilizer data: for 1987-1996, the 1992 NWALT was used; for 1997-2006, the 2002 NWALT was used; for 2007-2012, the 2012 NWALT was used.  This had the effect of apportioning the county statistic more accurately, rather than using a single year's land use raster.
(d) A check was performed to ensure that the sum of kg within each county matched the original tabular value, that is, 500 kg in the above example.  Minor differences may exist because of the spatial resolution of the 1-km raster datasets. For these rasters, 99% of counties matched the original values to within 5% agreement for farm fertilizer, and 97% of counties matched the original values to within 5% agreement for non-farm fertilizer.  The counties which had poorer agreement typically had small values for fertilizer kg, and thus had little effect on the overall mapping in any case. The raster datasets are stored as floating point ESRI Arc grids. 
This resulted in a series of 1-km raster datasets for which the original county statistics were allocated to feasible areas of the landscape, that is, areas which are reasonably likely to have farm or non-farm fertilizer. The datasets are designed as a source of information for calculating watershed statistics.</procdesc><procdate>20170426</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>(5) HUC-10 watershed means nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer were calculated using the zonalmean() command in ArcGIS Grid.</procdesc><procdate>20180123</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><eainfo><detailed Name="N-P_from_fertilizer_farmN-huc10.txt, N-P_from_fertilizer_farmP-huc10.txt, N-P_from_fertilizer_non-farmN-huc10.txt, N-P_from_fertilizer_non-farmP-huc10.txt"><enttyp><enttypl>Attribute Table for nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer data</enttypl><enttypd>Data consist of comma-separated text files.
