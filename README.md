# What Drives Water Quality?
Our team seeks to answer __"What has driven water quality in the United States over the last 30 years?"__<br/>
We will use [United States Geological Survey(USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/apis) data documenting water quality.<br/>
We will explore four likely drivers of water quality:
* Agriculture
* Geography
* Industry
* Population (including Urbanization)
# Methodology
For all four drivers, we will research 
* best data sources; and
* both nominal change and rate of change. 

To evaluate water quality, six variables are most useful:
1. Flow (called "Q"), as affected by runoff & precipitation
2. E. Coli concentration
3. Change in Ph
4. Phosphorus & Nitrogen content
5. Dams
6. Depths of water bodies

We will also determine whether a prefabricated index, like [PathFinder Science's Water Quality Index](http://www.pathfinderscience.net/stream/cproto4.cfm), will suffice.
